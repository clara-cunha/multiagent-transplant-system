# Multi-Agent System for Organ Transplant Management

Academic group project developed for the **Intelligent Systems** course (academic year 2024/2025).

**Team**: [Clara Cunha](https://github.com/clara-cunha), [Manuel Carvalho](https://github.com/Brisingrzzz)
, [Nuno Matos](https://github.com/Nuno-lxm) and Leonor Amorim

**Grade**: 19/20

## Overview

This project implements a **multi-agent system** to simulate and manage organ transplant logistics. The system includes four specialized agents:

- **AT (Transplant Agent)**: Manages organ allocation and fallback strategies.

- **AR (Receiver Agent)**: Handles patient lists and communicates updates.

- **ATR (Transport Agent)**: Simulates organ/patient transport with delays/failures.

- **AH (Hospital Agent)**: Creates patients/organs and manages hospital resources.


Together, these agents cooperate to ensure that transplant decisions are based on:
- Blood type compatibility
- Patient urgency
- Hospital resource availability
- Organ ischemia time
- Transportation time and failure risk

## Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/clara-cunha/multiagent-transplant-system

    cd multiagent-transplant-system
    ```

2. **Configure your XMPP credentials**

    Edit the *parameters.py* file with your server credentials:

    ```
    XMPP_SERVER = "your_server"
    PASSWORD = "your_password"
    ```

3. **Start your XMPP server**

    Make sure all agents can connect and communicate.

4. **Run the main script**

    ``` python main.py ```
